Simple Port Scanner Using Python
1. Introduction

Port scanning is a fundamental technique used in cybersecurity to identify open
network ports on a target system. Open ports may indicate running services and
potential security vulnerabilities. This project implements a simple TCP port
scanner using Python to demonstrate basic concepts of networking, reconnaissance,
and ethical security testing.

2. Objectives

The objectives of this project are:

To understand TCP/IP and socket programming

To learn how port scanning works at a basic level

To implement a functional cybersecurity tool in Python

To follow ethical guidelines in security testing

To improve code readability using meaningful comments and structure

3. Scope of the Project

This project focuses on:

Scanning TCP ports only

Small to medium port ranges

Educational and laboratory use

It does not include advanced features such as UDP scanning, exploit detection,
or real-world attack automation.

4. Tools and Technologies Used
Component	Description
Programming Language	Python 3
Libraries	socket, datetime
Operating System	Windows / Linux
Environment	Local machine or virtual lab
5. System Architecture

The system follows a simple sequential architecture:

User inputs target hostname/IP

Hostname is resolved to IP address

TCP socket is created for each port

Connection attempt is made

Open ports are recorded and displayed

6. Methodology
Step 1: Input Collection

The user provides:

Target hostname or IP address

Start and end port numbers

Step 2: Hostname Resolution

The program resolves the hostname using DNS to obtain the IP address.

Step 3: Port Scanning

For each port in the specified range:

A TCP socket is created

A connection attempt is made using connect_ex()

A timeout is applied to avoid delays

Step 4: Result Collection

Ports returning successful connections are marked as open

Open ports are stored in a list

Step 5: Output Display

Open ports are displayed to the user

Scan start and end time are recorded

7. Algorithm

Start program

Accept target input

Resolve hostname to IP

Accept port range

For each port:

Create TCP socket

Attempt connection

If successful, mark port as open

Display results

End program

8. Ethical Considerations

Port scanning can be interpreted as malicious activity if performed without
authorization. Therefore:

The tool must be used only on systems owned by the user

Permission must be obtained before scanning external systems

The project is strictly for educational purposes

9. Results and Observations

The scanner successfully:

Identifies open TCP ports

Handles invalid hostnames gracefully

Avoids unnecessary delays using socket timeouts

Sample output includes:

Open ports found

Scan duration

Target IP address

10. Limitations

Sequential scanning is slow for large port ranges

No service or banner detection

TCP only (UDP not supported)

No logging or report generation

11. Future Enhancements

Multithreaded port scanning

Service and version detection

Output results to file

Command-line argument support

Graphical user interface (GUI)

12. Learning Outcomes

Through this project, the following concepts were learned:

Basics of TCP/IP networking

Socket programming in Python

Ethical hacking fundamentals

Secure and readable code documentation

Practical cybersecurity reconnaissance techniques

13. Conclusion

This project demonstrates how basic cybersecurity tools are built using Python.
By implementing a simple port scanner, the project provides hands-on experience
with networking concepts and establishes a strong foundation for advanced
security tools and defensive analysis.
