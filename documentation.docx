# 🔐 Simple Port Scanner Using Python

## 📌 Introduction
Port scanning is a fundamental technique in cybersecurity used to identify open
network ports on a target system. Open ports may indicate active services and
potential security vulnerabilities.

This project implements a **simple TCP port scanner using Python** to demonstrate
basic networking, reconnaissance, and ethical security testing concepts.

> have explicit permission to test.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand TCP/IP and socket programming
- Learn how port scanning works
- Build a functional cybersecurity tool in Python
- Practice ethical hacking principles
- Improve code readability and documentation

---

## 📦 Project Scope
- TCP port scanning only
- Small to medium port ranges
- Educational and lab-based usage
- No exploit or attack automation

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

| Component | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Language | Python 3 |
| Libraries | `socket`, `datetime` |
| OS | Windows / Linux |
| Environment | Local machine or virtual lab |

## 🧱 System Architecture
The project follows a **sequential scanning architecture**:

1. User inputs target hostname or IP
2. Hostname is resolved to an IP address
3. TCP socket is created for each port
4. Connection attempt is made
5. Open ports are recorded and displayed

---

## ⚙️ Methodology

### Step 1: Input Collection
The user provides:
- Target hostname or IP address
- Start and end port numbers

### Step 2: Hostname Resolution
The hostname is resolved using DNS to obtain the target IP address.

### Step 3: Port Scanning
For each port in the given range:
- A TCP socket is created
- `connect_ex()` attempts a connection
- Timeout prevents long delays

### Step 4: Result Collection
- Successfully connected ports are marked as open
- Open ports are stored in a list

### Step 5: Output Display
- Open ports are printed
- Scan start and end time are displayed

## 🧮 Algorithm
1. Start program  
2. Accept target input  
3. Resolve hostname to IP  
4. Accept port range  
5. For each port:  
   - Create TCP socket  
   - Attempt connection  
   - If successful, mark port as open  
6. Display results  
7. End program

## 🔐 Ethical Considerations
Port scanning can be considered malicious if performed without authorization.

- Scan only systems you own or have permission to test
- Do not scan public or private networks without consent
- Intended for educational use only

## 📊 Results & Observations
- Successfully identifies open TCP ports
- Handles invalid hostnames gracefully
- Socket timeout improves performance
- Clean and readable output
