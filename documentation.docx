Title

Simple Port Scanner Using Python

1. Introduction

Cybersecurity reconnaissance involves identifying open ports and services on a
target system. This project implements a simple TCP port scanner to understand
how attackers and defenders analyze network exposure.

2. Objectives

Learn basic socket programming

Understand TCP port scanning

Practice ethical cybersecurity principles

Build a functional security tool in Python

3. Tools & Technologies

Python 3

Socket programming

Windows/Linux OS

4. Methodology

Resolve target hostname to IP

Create TCP socket

Attempt connection to each port

Record open ports

Display results to user

5. Ethical Considerations

This scanner must only be used on systems owned by the user or with explicit
authorization. Unauthorized scanning is illegal and unethical.

6. Results

The scanner successfully identifies open TCP ports within a specified range
on the target system.

7. Limitations

Slow for large port ranges

No service detection

TCP only

8. Future Scope

Multithreaded scanning

Banner grabbing

GUI interface

Logging and reporting

9. Conclusion

This project provides hands-on experience with networking fundamentals and
serves as a foundation for advanced cybersecurity tools.
